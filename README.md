*Cross platform uploader for Mocha written in Python and designed to be compiled with pyinstaller*

# **WIP**                                             
|**CURRENT ISSUES**|
| :---- |
|<ul><li>~~Share link creation creates share but provides incorrect link~~</li><li>Folder upload just dumps all files in root without creating new folder</li><li>~~Original file names not being listed~~</li><li>~~Unable to move files~~</li><li>Unable to ~~create~~ or view shares</li><li>~~Large file upload is not working correctly~~</li><li>~~Uploading to specific existing folders is not functioning~~</li><li>Moving files or folders deeper than one folder does not function</li><li>~~Uploading deeper than one folder is not working~~</li></ul>|


## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher (can be downloader [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PyQt6 (can be installed with `pip install PyQt6`)
- requests (can be installed with `pip install requests`)
- pyinstaller (can be installed with `pip install pyinstaller`)
- A Mocha account and an API key

## Features
- Uploads files to Mocha with a simple drag and drop interface, or selection through file manager.
- Folder upload support (note issues listed above)
- Upload speed and progress indicators
- Create share links with all options from within the program
- Ability to view files and folders (note issues listed above)
- Togglable debug mode for easier troubleshooting

## Potential? Ideas
| Idea | Complete? |
| :---- | :----: |
| Add download support for your own files | ❌ |
| Create android version | ❌ |
| Add to context menu (traditiional and Windows 11 (maybe idk how that works yet) for easy uploading | ❌ |
| Complete control over files, deletion, moving, sharing, etc. | ❌ |
| Debug and token management in its own tab | ✅ |
